# Podifi Web Onboarding

This project was built using Podifi's Onboarding (Web) hands on exercise. The app is a modern, responsive web application built with React and using Nodejs express as a backend. Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a basic understanding of JavaScript and React.
- You have Node.js installed on your machine. Node.js is required to use npm (Node Package Manager), which manages the dependencies of the application.

## Setup and Installation

To set up FastServeWeb, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Node

If you haven't installed Node.js, download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm, which is required to manage the application's dependencies.

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

This will display the versions of Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root directory of the FastServeWeb project in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all the necessary dependencies required for the application as defined in the `package.json` file.

### 3. Start the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts the development server and opens the application in your default web browser. By default, the application will be available at `http://localhost:5174`.

## Usage

After starting the application, you can navigate through the app in your web browser. The application is set up with a development server that will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
